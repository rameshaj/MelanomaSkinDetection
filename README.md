## General Information

### Algorithms Used

Neural Network

### Dataset Information

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Steps Involved

- Data Loading
- Baseline Model Building
- Training the Model and testing the model
- Building an augmented model
- Training the augmented model and testing the model
- Countering Class Imbalance with augmentor
- Building the final model
- Training the final model and testing the model
- Verifying the model

## Results

Data Augmentation Impact:
Data augmentation has likely helped the model generalize better to unseen data, as indicated by the improvement in validation accuracy and reduction in the gap between training and validation performance. Augmentation strategies such as random flipping, rotation, and zooming have helped introduce variability into the training data, which has reduced overfitting.

Class Rebalancing Impact:
The class rebalancing has also helped improve the model's performance, particularly in preventing overfitting on dominant classes. The more balanced dataset ensures that the model doesn't focus too heavily on any one class, leading to better overall generalization.

Remaining Issues:
Although the model has improved after augmentation and rebalancing, there are still signs of overfitting toward the later epochs. Validation loss fluctuates, and there are some sharp jumps in validation accuracy, which could be due to noise or the sensitivity of the model to certain validation samples. Further regularization techniques, such as early stopping or stronger dropout, might help in stabilizing validation performance and reducing overfitting even more.
# Conclusion

As the accuracy of the model increases, the loss decreases. The final model has an accuracy of 87% and a loss of 0.3. The model is able to predict the class of the lesion with a high accuracy.
Augmenting the data and countering class imbalance helped in improving the accuracy of the model.
